Hi there! My name's Prithvi S.B, but on the internet, I prefer to go by my sobriquet *Pritt*.

I currently live in **Trichy**, a little city in Tamil Nadu, India. I study in one of the most reputed colleges in the country, the **National Institute of Technology, Trichy**.

Apart from the usual studies, I have a passion for organic chemistry, astronomy, and coding (albeit new to it). I participate in *Chemistry StackExchange*, a Q&A site that is in the same network of Q&A sites as **StackOverflow** (in which I do participate to an extent), the most popular programming Q&A site ever. I also like build **LEGO** structures and solve the Rubik's cube.

In my free time, I usually read novels, play *Clash of Clans*, or chat in **Discord** (you can find me in the r/clashofclans official server). I code bots for my favorite servers using Node.js.
